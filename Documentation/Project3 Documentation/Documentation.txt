Team 12 Project 3 Documentation

04/03/22 - B/W to RGB Project Prototype

[Person-Hour Estimation]
	| Total: 15 Hours
	| This is a rough estimate time from choosing a good topic for the Project 3.
	Since topic was not given to the team, we suspect quite of time will be 
	spent choosing a topic. Total 15 hours include discussion, meeting, coding,
	documentation, and research needed for Project 3. About 5 person hours to 
	decide on the topic and research about the planned topic. About 10 person
	hours to discuss the plans and building a prototype.

[Code Documentation]
	| This project is using the source code of @richzhang (Github) as a base
	code.
	| Project is written in Python
	| We will be adding UI for the program and implementing functions for UI.
	| This project will be a prototype of [Project 4]

	| This program converts B/W image to a RGB image (colorization). Users are
	able to choose a file and colorize the image. Image will be resized to fit
	the canvas for the program. Program "communicates" with the neural network
	and recieves corresponding data into a variable to colorize the image, and
	resizes to its original dimension of the image. Converts to an RGB image
	based on the ab data for the image display. Finally, program displays the
	final RGB image to the user.

	| main.py is the default process handler for colorization.

	| interface.py is the default UI/Form handler for user to view.
