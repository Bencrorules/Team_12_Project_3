[Costs for hiring developers]
In the next year our project most likely will not receive any major updates. 
Some smaller bug fixing or quality of life updates will need to be made. We 
will also need to perform adaptive and preventive maintenance to keep our project 
working as intended as we live in a world with rapidly evolving technology.

We won't need to hire full time developers to maintain the project as the scope 
is not extremely large. At most hiring part time developers would be enough, but 
is most likely not needed. That leaves us with two choices. Our group could continue 
development on the project in our free time as a hobby or what is probably the best 
choice for our project will be to open source the project. Open sourcing will eliminate 
the cost for hiring developers entirely. 

[Fees for servers and domain names]
Depending on our needs for server space the monthly cost of renting a server would be 
$100-$200. We could also go the route of a cloud server which is significantly cheaper 
starting at $5 a month or $60 a year. A cloud server at most would be around $40 a month 
or $480 dollars a year. (Prices quoted from servermania.com)

The annual fee for a domain name is roughly in the range of $10-$20 a year.

[Fees for distribution platform]
The cost of fees for making our project available on different distribution platforms will 
vary a little from platform to platform. If our project is a paid application then each 
distribution platform will take a percentage of the annual net app revenue. If our project 
is available for free then we won't have to worry about the distribution platform taking a 
commission fee. Listed below are a few distribution platforms and the fees that they charge.

Apple App Store fees - There are no hosting fees, but there's an annual fee of $99 for the 
Apple Developer Program. Apple also takes either 30% of app revenue when making more than 
$1 million in annual net app revenue or 15% when making less than $1 million in annual net revenue. 

Google Play Store fees - Like Apple, Google also takes a 30% share of revenue, but after 1 
year that share is reduced to 15%. There is a one-time registration fee of $25 for a developer account.

Amazon Appstore fees - 30% share of revenue.

Microsoft Store fees - 30% share of revenue. One-time registration fee of $19 for an 
individual developer account or $99 for a company developer account.

However, our project will most likely be open sourced or a hobby project so it would be 
better if we simply make the repository for the project available on GitHub and then there 
will be a $0 cost for distribution.

[Total Fees]
To maintain our project for the next year will end up being on the cheaper side of maintaining 
software. At the absolute most it will be around $500 for the year. The majority of this cost is 
for a cloud server and we could cut the cost for that down quite a bit depending on our need for 
storage. The total maintenance cost for our project will end up being between $70 to $500.
