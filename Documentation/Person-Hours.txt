[1.5 hours/Story Point]
    We arrived at 1.5hours/Story Point by using 
    the total hours it took to complete Project 3.
    Project 3 took roughly 20 hours to complete. For
    Project 4's story point estimation we decided that 
    Project 3 belongs in pool 13, so taking 20 hours
    divided by 13 story points we roughly get 1.5hours/Story Point.
